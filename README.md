Supplementary information for Vu et al. (2024)

Two files are required to run our analysis:

1.  Specimen data (standard lenth, photophore areas, lens diameters)
    that are contained in a single file `eye_PO_data.csv`.

2.  Flux data was modeled on the output of Aristostomias scintillans
    reported Mensinger and Case (1990, J. of Exp. Mar. Biol. & Ecol.
    144:1–15). The data for this study are in `mes.cas.flux.dat.csv`.

All scripts that perform the analysis and produced the figures and
tables are contained in the markdown file `Vu_et_al_Supplement.Rmd`

Any inquiries concerning the analysis can be made to Dr. Christopher
Kenaley (kenaley\[at\]bc.edu).
